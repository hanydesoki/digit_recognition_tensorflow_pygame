# digit_recognition_tensorflow_pygame
This is an implementation of a digit recognition model in a pygame app. We can draw a digit and it will guess the right number.

Run main.py to try this out. We need to install pygame module and tensorflow / numpy to be able to run the program.

There is a screenshot of the app in exapmle.jpg

The model is trained with the mnist data from tensorflow with notebook in "reconnaissance_nombre" directory. The model is saved in "model_mnist.h5"
